# SensorLoader: Automating Sensor-Processor Communication Mapping
SensorLoader is a powerful tool designed to automate the memory mapping of distinct communication methods between a system processor and sensor devices. In the realm of cyber-physical security, it plays a vital role in identifying vulnerabilities and deviations from expected behaviors, offering an efficient pathway to securing complex systems.

Project Overview
In today's world, cyber-physical systems are becoming increasingly prevalent. These systems combine software and hardware components to control and interact with the physical world. Ensuring the security of these systems is paramount, as they are susceptible to various types of attacks.

One significant challenge in cyber-physical security is understanding how different sensor devices communicate with a system processor. Traditionally, engineers had to manually cross-reference lengthy PDF documents from device manufacturers to decipher data transmission details. This manual process was not only extensive and time-consuming but also diverted valuable resources away from the actual defense implementation.

SensorLoader is here to change that. It automates the process of analyzing multiple PDFs that describe how sensors connect to a specific system processor. By doing so, it extracts valuable information that is then overlaid onto a reverse engineering framework. This overlaying process provides semantic meaning to the communication methods used between the system processor and onboarded peripheral devices.

Key Features
Memory Mapping Automation
SensorLoader automates the process of memory mapping, making it significantly more efficient and accurate compared to manual methods. It can handle various communication methods, streamlining the understanding of how sensors interact with the system processor.

Vulnerability Identification
By automating the memory mapping process, SensorLoader aids in identifying vulnerabilities within cyber-physical systems. It helps pinpoint potential weaknesses in the communication pathways, allowing for timely and targeted security enhancements.

Query-Based Analysis
SensorLoader offers a Query and Answer (QA) feature, allowing users to input queries about specific aspects of their projects. These queries are processed by the program, which uses unstructured analysis to parse documents for relevant information.

High Accuracy Information Extraction
Through extensive testing, SensorLoader has consistently demonstrated the ability to extract information from PDFs with an impressive 100% accuracy rate. This accuracy is crucial for making informed decisions about the security of your systems.

How It Works
SensorLoader uses advanced analysis techniques to process PDF documents describing the communication methods between sensors and system processors. It automates the extraction of relevant information and maps it onto a reverse engineering framework. This process provides clear insights into how the system processor communicates with peripheral devices.

Benefits
Efficiency: SensorLoader significantly reduces the time and effort required for understanding communication methods, allowing your team to focus on implementing effective defenses.

Accuracy: With a 100% accuracy rate in information extraction, SensorLoader provides reliable data for decision-making.

Enhanced Security: By identifying vulnerabilities and deviations, SensorLoader plays a crucial role in enhancing the security of your cyber-physical systems.

Streamlined Documentation: Say goodbye to lengthy, manual PDF cross-referencing. SensorLoader streamlines the documentation analysis process.
